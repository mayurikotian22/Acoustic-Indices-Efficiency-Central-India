# Source code for examining the efficiency of acoustic indices for quantifying biodiversity
This repository contains R Markdown files and data for the research article titled "Measuring biodiversity with sound: How effective are acoustic indices for quantifying biodiversity in a tropical dry forest?".
# Data
The data was collected using the Audiomoth acoustic recorders in the buffer region of Kanha National Park in the state of Madhya Pradesh in India.
# Source code 
The code in each R Markdown file was written to achieve the following:

1. 01-Computation-of-acoustic-indices: This .Rmd file was used to compute the acoustic indices for each file.
2. 02-Correlation-analysis: This .Rmd file was used to test the linear and non-linear relationship between acoustic indices and avian species richness, a meeasure of overall biodiversity in our sites.
3. 03-GLMM-and-Dredged-Models: This .Rmd file was used to run the generalized linear mixed-effects model and uses dredging to rank models.
4. AI_SR: This .CSV file contains the data for acoustic indices and avian species richness that was used for the correlation and GLMM analyses.
